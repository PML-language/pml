This folder contains files related to the PML2 project.

The source files can be found in the following folders:
 - "util" contains a set of libraries not directly related to PML2,
 - "parser" contains a low level AST of the language and the parser,
 - "kernel" contains the core of PML2 (type checking, equivalence, AST...),
 - "pml2" contains the main program.

Other directories:
 - "doc" contains the documentation of some modules (generated by ocamldoc),
 - "editors" contains PML2 modes for editors (vim and emacs only),
 - "lib" contains the PML2 standard library (very small),
 - "test" contains most of our examples of PML2 programs,
 - "phd_examples" contains the examples that are included in my thesis,

The directories "tmp" and "attic" are not relevant as the contain files used
for debugging the newest features including termination checking and old code
that we want to keep somewhere.


The program can be compiled and optionally installed as follows.

  make && make install

You can edit Makefile.config to change/see the default installation dirs.

The documentation (very incomplete) can be produced as follows.

  make doc

This generates the documentation of the ML modules for developers

My advice to start looking at the code would be to take a look at the three
different abstract syntax representations.
 - The main abstract syntax is implemented as a GADT in kernel/ast.ml,
 - The abstract syntax after parsing can be found in parser/raw.ml, together
   with the first level of type checking (sorting),
 - The graph representation of terms for the decision of equivalence can be
   found in ast/equiv.ml.

The implementation of type checking can be found in kernel/typing.ml, and the
function for comparing expressions (including the unification functions) are
in kernel/compare.ml.
